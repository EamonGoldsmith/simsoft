goal for this project:

- 3d view of model in world
- option to generate from seed
- rigid body physics simulation
- soft body physics simulation
- vector field forces simulation
- bouancy simulation


how it will work:

Three menus for world, objects and assemblies.
world is generated from seed, can be edited with sliders, or model imported
ocean is also available with sliders for tide strength and wave height

objects and assemblies are arranged in a file heirarchy, objects can be either soft or rigid
assemblies are composed of multiple objects. objects can be given mass and coefficient of friction

objects are connected by attachments which can be fixed, rotational, linear, swing or cord.
Each of these attachments can be edited

vector fields can be used for tide, wind, thrust and drag.
feilds are programmed with functions or presets (wind, water, convection).

actuators are special types of connections that can apply a force in the given range of motion.

sensors can be placed on objects that take a picture, get field magnitude (wind speed),
global direction or distance to an object.
